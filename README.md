# SampleTVMLClient

Sample project to display/play a selection of Movies in TVML.

### Part 1 - Introduction
Strongly based on the documentation available in the apple developer documentation. Create a two page interface, a collection template that contains one movie that when selected launches a product template with more details about the movie.

### Part 2 - Dynamic Content
Begin to turn the project away from static content to requesting JSON data to dynamically populate the template with data. This part includes requesting JSON data, populating the category template with the templates and movies, and on movie selection, displaying details about the selected movie.

## Part 3 - Menu Bar and Searching
Redefine the app by having a menu of "home" and "search". The focus of this part is on the implementation of a menu and the concept of searching. Without a valid endpoint for handling search requests, the searching functionality is faked within the JavaScript.
